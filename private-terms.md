# npm Private Packages Terms

These npm Private Packages Terms of Use (these _npm Private Packages
Terms_) supplement the terms for npm Open Source offered by npm, Inc.
(_npm_) at <https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms> (_npm
Open Source Terms_). They govern access to and use of _npm Private
Packages_, the personal private package storage and delivery features of
<https://www.npmjs.com> (the _Website_) and the npm public registry at
<https://registry.npmjs.org> (the _Public Registry_).

These npm Private Packages Terms were last updated on
November 18, 2015. You can review prior versions at
<https://github.com/npm/policies/commits/master/private-modules-terms.md>.

You may only access or use npm Private Packages by agreeing to the npm
Open Source Terms as supplemented by these npm Private Packages Terms. If
npm adds any additional functionality to npm Private Packages, you must
agree to these npm Private Packages Terms to use those new features, too.
You add these npm Private Packages Terms to your agreement with npm by
enabling npm Private Packages for your account (your _Account_). These
npm Private Packages Terms then become a part of the contract between you
and npm, until you or npm disable npm Private Packages for your Account.

## npm Private Packages

npm will provide the features and services described
in the public documentation for npm Private Packages at
<https://www.npmjs.com/private-modules>, and npm grants you permission
to use those features and services. That permission isn't exclusive to
you, and you can't transfer it or give rights to use npm Private Packages
to others.

Both your permission to use npm Private Packages and npm's commitment
to provide npm Private Packages are subject to these npm Private
Packages Terms, the npm Open Source Terms, and the following additional
conditions:

1.  When enabling npm Private Packages for your Account, you must provide
    all the payment card details requested by the Website (your _Payment
    Details_). Those details must be for a valid payment card that you
    have the right to use (your _Payment Card_). You must keep your
    Payment Details up-to-date via the Website.

2.  You must pay $7.00 via your Payment Card when you enable npm Private
    Packages and at the beginning of each successive month-long period
    while npm Private Packages remains enabled for your Account.
