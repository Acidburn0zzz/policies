# Dispute Resolution

This document describes the steps that you should take to resolve user name
disputes with other registered npm users.

This document is a clarification of the acceptable behavior outlined in
the [npm Code of Conduct](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct), and
nothing in this document should be interpreted to contradict any aspect
of the npm Code of Conduct.

## tl;dr

1. Get the email associated with the desired user name from the profile page: `https://www.npmjs.com/~<user_name>`
2. Email the author, CC <support@npmjs.com>
3. After a few weeks, if there's no resolution, we'll sort it out.

## Description

As our community grows, so does the number of claimed user names or scopes. Occasionally, a user tries to create a new personal user account or organization, only to discover that the desired scope has already been taken.

1. Ricardo creates a personal user account, `coolestname`, planning to become active within the JavaScript community. They start, but soon move on to other platforms leaving their user account unused. Some time later, Irina comes along and wants to use the `coolestname` name as it matches what they use elsewhere.
2. Ricardo creates a personal user account, `nextbiggestthing`. They're not attached to the name, but thought it would be popular someday. Later, Irina attempts to create an organization with the `nextbiggestthing` scope matching their Next Biggest Thing Co.
3. Ricardo creates an organization using the `thisisit` scope. They want to try out the organization features but decide the subscription isn't needed for their work flow and cancel. Irina is excited to join the npm community and attempts to create a personal user account with the `thisisit` scope.

Irina's claims to the already uses scopes is debatable, but their course of actions are the same.

1. The profile page of an existing user account will give Irina the email address of the owner of the user name, `https://www.npmjs.com/~<user_name>`. If not matching profile is found, but they're alerted the scope has already been take, it may be associated with an organization rather than a personal user account. In that case, they can reach out to the support team <support@npmjs.com> and they'll help identify the organization super-admin and associated email.
2. Irina emails the owner and expresses their desire to take over and user the scope for their own personal or organization account. They add the npm support staff <support@npmjs.com> to the CC list of the email.
3. After a reasonable amount of time, if Ricardo has not responded, or if Ricardo and Irina can't come to any sort of resolution, support <support@npmjs.com> will follow up. ("Reasonable" is usually at least 4 weeks.) Without consent from the current owner, we'd be inclined to leave things as they are. 

## Reasoning

In most cases so far, the parties involved have been able to
reach an amicable resolution without any major intervention.  Most
people really do want to be reasonable, and are probably not even
aware that they're in your way.

When humans solve their problems by
talking to other humans with respect, everyone has the chance to end
up feeling good about the interaction.
