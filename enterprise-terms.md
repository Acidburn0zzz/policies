# npm Enterprise Self-Serve License Terms

These npm Enterprise Self-Serve License Terms (version v5.1.0) and
the webpage form submitted to npmjs.com to license npm Enterprise (the
**Signup Form**) comprise an agreement between npm, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (**npm**) and the licensee identified on the _Signup Form_
(**Licensee**).

## Background

_npm_ develops and provides computer software and services (**npm
Offerings**) for installing, managing, and sharing packages of computer
code, data, and programs (**Packages**).  _npm Offerings_ include a
command-line interface (**CLI**) for interacting with repositories of
_Packages_ (each a **Registry**), a publicly accessible _Registry_
at registry.npmjs.com (the **Public Registry**), and a website
interface for interacting with the _Public Registry_ at npmjs.com
(the **Website**).

_npm_ also develops software (**npm Enterprise**) for hosting a
_Registry_ (a **Private Registry**).

## Enterprise Components

_npm Enterprise_ is made up of:

1.  **npm's Packages**, _Packages_ that _npm_ owns and maintains:

    1.  _Open-Source Packages_ _npm_ publishes to the _Public Registry_

    2.  _Proprietary Packages_ _npm_ publishes to enterprise.npmjs.com,
        an npm-operated _Registry_ (the **Proprietary npm Registry**)
        for use by _npm Enterprise_ licensees

2.  **Third-Party Packages**, _Packages_ not owned and maintained by _npm_:

    1.  _Packages_ third parties publish to the _Public Registry_
        that _npm's Packages_ _Utilize_

    2.  _Packages_ third parties publish to software repositories
        associated with distributions of the Linux operating system
        (**Linux Distribution Repositories**), such as Debian package
        repositories, that _npm's Packages_ _Utilize_

    3.  _Packages_ third parties publish in source code form to
        software source code hosting platforms (**Source Code Hosts**),
        such as github.com, that _npm's Packages_ _Utilize_

3.  the **License API**, an application programming interface operated
    by _npm_ at license.npmjs.com for managing _npm Enterprise_
    license keys (each a **License Key**)

## Licenses<a id="licenses"></a>

_npm_ grants _Licensee_ a nonexclusive license (the **Software
License**) to install and use _npm Enterprise_.  _npm_ further grants
_Licensee_ a nonexclusive right to use the _Proprietary npm Registry_
and the _License API_ to install, use, and update _npm Enterprise_
(the **Services License**).  Both the _Software License_ and the
_Services License_ (the **Licenses**) are subject to the other terms
of this agreement, including payment of fees (**License Fees**)
and number of seats (**Seats**).

## Subscription

If _Licensee_ has not licensed _npm Enterprise_ before and elects
to receive a free trial via the _Signup Form_, _Licensee_ will pay
no _License Fees_, and have an unlimited number of _Seats_, for the
first 30 days of the _Term_ (the **Free Trial**).  After any _Free
Trial_, _Licensee_ will have the number of _Seats_ _Licensee_ selects
via the _Website_, or, if _Licensee_ chooses to pay by invoice, the
number of _Seats_ stated on each successive invoice.  _License Fees_
for each _Month_ after any _Free Trial_ will be the price indicated
by the _Signup Form_ times the number of _Seats_ _Licensee_ has for
that _Month_.

## Permitted Use

The _Licenses_ let _Licensee_:

1.  download and install _npm's Packages_ from the _Public Registry_
    and _Proprietary npm Registry_ run _npm Enterprise_ to operate
    a _Private Registry_ (**Licensee's Registry**)

2.  allow as many _Authorized Personnel_ to make requests of
    _Licensee's Registry_ in any _Month_ as _Licensee_ has _Seats_
    for that _Month_

3.  make a reasonable number of backup copies of _npm's Packages_ to
    protect against data loss or inability to access the _Public
    Registry_ and _Proprietary npm Registry_

## Prohibited Uses

The _Licenses_ do not let _Licensee_:

1.  license, sell, or lease _npm Enterprise_ to third parties

2.  facilitate or allow use of _npm Enterprise_ by third parties

3.  exceed the permissions given by licenses for any _Third-Party
    Packages_

4.  remove or destroy any marking showing ownership, like a copyright
    or trademark notice, from any component of _npm Enterprise_

5.  disable, avoid, or circumvent any security or access restrictions
    of _npm Offerings_, or access parts of _npm Offerings_ not intended
    for access by you

6.  strain infrastructure of _npm Offerings_, such as the _Public
    Registry_, _Proprietary npm Registry_, or _License API_ with an
    unreasonable volume of requests, or requests that might impose
    an unreasonable load on _npm_ IT systems

## Responsibility and Audit<a id="responsibility-and-audit"></a>

If any _Authorized Personnel_ breaches any term of the _Licenses_, or
if any third party breaches the terms of the License under _Licensee_'s
direction or with _Licensee_'s help, this agreement will treat that
breach as if committed by _Licensee_ itself.  During the _Term_,
_npm_ may audit _Licensee_'s compliance with this agreement and the
_Licenses_ at most once per calendar year.

## License Key

_npm_ shall give _Licensee_ _Notice_ containing a _License Key_ no
later than the third _Business Day_ after the date of this agreement.
Every _License Key_ is _Confidential Information_ of npm.

## Documentation

During the _Term_, _npm_ shall publish documentation for _npm
Enterprise_ that enables a computer professional skilled in
the installation and administration of server software on the
Linux operating system to host _Licensee's Registry_ using
_npm Enterprise_, and to configure the features described in
[Functionality](#functionality) (**Documentation**).

## Support

### Support Requests

_npm_ shall provide support during the _Term_ (**Support Services**)

_Licensee_'s use of the _Public Registry_, _Website_, and _npm
Offerings_ other than _npm Enterprise_, if any, is governed by the
terms for use of those _npm Offerings_.

## Payment

funds denominated in United States dollars within 30 calendar days
of receipt.  _Licensee_ shall pay interest of 1.5% per month (or
the highest legal rate) on overdue invoiced amounts.  No _License

## Indemnification<a id="indemnification">

### Indemnification by npm<a id="indemnification-by-npm"></a>

Subject to [Indemnification Exceptions](#indemnification-exceptions),
_npm_ shall indemnify and hold _Licensee_ harmless for all liability,
expenses, damages, and costs from any third-party claims, demands,
lawsuits, or other actions alleging that _Licensee_'s use of _npm
Enterprise_ infringes any third-party copyright or trade secret right.
To be indemnified, _Licensee_ must provide _Notice_ of any action
as soon as possible, allow _npm_ to control defense and settlement,
and cooperate with that defense.

### Indemnification Exceptions<a id="indemnification-exceptions"></a>

_npm_ will not indemnify _Licensee_ for any third-party action based
on any of:

1.  use of _npm Enterprise_ in breach of this agreement

2.  use of _npm Enterprise_ as _Licensee_ modified, added to, or
    combined it with other software, equipment, or data (**Licensee
    Combination**), if infringement would not have occurred without
    _Licensee Combination_ and _Licensee Combination_ was not described
    by the _Documentation_

    if _Licensee_ received _Notice_ that infringement could have been
    avoided by using the _Latest Stable Version_

    using those _Third-Party Packages_ alone, and not as part of _npm
    Enterprise_ or to install _npm Enterprise_

5.  use of _npm Enterprise_ after receiving notice from a third party,
    or otherwise becoming aware, that use infringes a third-party
    copyright or trade secret right, unless _Licensee_ gave _Notice_ of

infringement of any _Intellectual Property Right_.

### Mitigation

If a third party brings an action covered by [Indemnification by
npm](#indemnification-by-npm), or if _npm_ believes a third party
will likely bring an action, _npm_ may secure _Licensee_ the right to
continue using _npm Enterprise_, replace or modify _npm Enterprise_ to
avoid infringement, or, if neither of those is reasonably possible,
terminate this agreement and refund all _License Fees_ paid by
_Licensee_.

### Indemnification by Licensee

_Licensee_ shall indemnify and hold _npm_ harmless for all liability,
expenses, damages, and costs from actions under [Indemnification
Exceptions](#indemnification-exceptions) as well as any third-party
claims, demands, lawsuits, or other actions based on breach of this
agreement by _Licensee_ or content _Licensee_ stores using _npm
Enterprise_.

## General

### Term

the Northern District of California, or, if there is no federal subject
matter jurisdiction, in any state court sitting in San Francisco,
California.  The parties waive objection to exclusive jurisdiction,
venue, or forum when a _Dispute_ is brought in such a court.
