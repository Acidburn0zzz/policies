# npm Orgs Terms

These npm Orgs Terms of Use (these _npm Orgs Terms_) supplement
the terms for npm Open Source offered by npm, Inc. (_npm_) at
<https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms> (_npm Open Source
Terms_). They govern access to and use of _npm Orgs_, the organization
private package storage, delivery, and access control features of
<https://www.npmjs.com> (the _Website_) and the npm public registry at
<https://registry.npmjs.com> (the _Public Registry_).

These npm Orgs Terms were last updated on

You may only access or use npm Orgs by agreeing to the npm Open

additional functionality to npm Orgs, you must agree to these npm Orgs
Terms to use those new features, too. You add these npm Orgs Terms to
your agreement with npm by enabling npm Orgs for your account on the
Website (your _Account_). These npm Orgs Terms then become a part of the
